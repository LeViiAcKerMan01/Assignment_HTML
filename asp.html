<h1>ASP</h1>
<p>ASP, or Active Server Pages, is a server-side scripting language developed by 
   Microsoft for creating dynamic web pages and web applications. It allows developers
   to embed code within HTML pages, which are then processed by the web server to 
   generate dynamic content. ASP uses VBScript or JScript as its scripting language
   and supports interaction with databases and other server-side technologies. 
   ASP is part of the Microsoft .NET framework and is often used in conjunction with 
   other Microsoft technologies such as Visual Studio, SQL Server, and Windows Server. 
   It is a popular choice for developing enterprise-level web applications and is widely
   used in corporate environments.</p>

    <p>JSP, or JavaServer Pages, is a server-side technology that is used to create 
        dynamic web pages. It was developed by Sun Microsystems and is now maintained by
     Oracle. JSP allows developers to embed Java code into HTML pages, which are then 
     compiled into servlets that can run on a web server. This allows for the creation
      of dynamic web pages that can respond to user input and interact with databases.
       JSP is a popular choice for developing web applications and is widely used in
        enterprise environments. It is often used in conjunction with other Java 
    technologies, such as Servlets, JPA, and Spring Framework.</p>
    <h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF JSP</h2>
    <p>Server-side technology: JSP is a server-side technology that allows developers to create dynamic web pages that can interact with databases, process data, and handle user input.
    <br>
        Java-based: JSP is based on Java and allows developers to use Java code to create dynamic content on the web page.
        <br>
        Easy integration: JSP can be easily integrated with other Java technologies, such as Servlets, JPA, and Spring Framework.
        <br>
        High performance: JSP pages can be precompiled into Java servlets, which makes them faster and more efficient than traditional CGI scripts.
        <br>
        Separation of logic and presentation: JSP allows developers to separate the presentation layer from the business logic layer, which makes the code more maintainable and easier to debug.</p>
    <h2>APPLICATIONS OF JSP</h2>
    <p>Web development: JSP is widely used for web development, including e-commerce platforms, content management systems, and social media websites.
    <br>
        Dynamic web pages: JSP is used for creating dynamic web pages that can interact with databases, process data, and handle user input.
        <br>
        Enterprise applications: JSP is often used in enterprise environments for developing complex web applications that require high performance and scalability.
       <br> 
        Web services: JSP can be used to create web services that expose functionality to other applications over the internet.
        <br>
        Real-time web applications: JSP is used for developing real-time web applications, such as chat applications and stock tickers, that require frequent updates and interaction with users.

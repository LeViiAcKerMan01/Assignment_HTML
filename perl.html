    Reporting Language" and was originally designed for text processing tasks. Perl has 
    a flexible syntax and powerful regular expression support, making it easy to 
    manipulate text and data. Perl is widely used for web development, system 
    administration, and network programming tasks, as well as for tasks such as data 
    analysis and bioinformatics. Perl is open source and is available for multiple 
    platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

<article>
    <P>PHP is a server-side scripting language that was designed for web development.
        It was first released in 1995 by Rasmus Lerdorf, and has since become one of 
        the most widely used programming languages for web development. PHP stands for 
        Hypertext Preprocessor and is used to create dynamic web pages that interact 
        with databases, handle user input, and process data. PHP code is executed on 
        the server, which generates HTML that is sent to the client's web browser.
         PHP is an open-source language and has a large community of developers who 
   have created a vast library of tools and frameworks to make it easier to develop web
    applications.</P>

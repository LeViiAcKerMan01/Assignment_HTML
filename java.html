 <h1>Java Language</h1>
<article>
    <P>Java is a popular, high-level programming language that was first released in 1995
        by Sun Microsystems. It is an object-oriented language that is designed to be 
       platform-independent, meaning that Java code can be run on any device that has a
       Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Java has become one of the most widely-used
        programming languages in the world, and is used in a wide range of applications, 
        including web and mobile app development, scientific computing, and enterprise 
        software development. Java's popularity is due in part to its ease of use, 
        flexibility, and wide range of features and capabilities.</P>
       <h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF JAVA</h2>
       <p>Platform Independence: Java code can be executed on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. This makes it a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications.
       <br>
           Garbage Collection: Java provides automatic garbage collection, which means that developers do not need to worry about memory management. This makes it easier to write code that is both efficient and expressive.
       <br>   
           Object-Oriented Programming: Java supports object-oriented programming, which allows developers to write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
       <br>    
           Security: Java provides built-in security features, including a security manager that can control access to system resources. This makes it a popular choice for developing applications that require a high level of security.
       <br>    
           Large Standard Library: Java provides a large standard library of built-in functions and classes, which makes it easier for developers to write code that is both efficient and expressive.
       </p>   
           <h2>APPLICATIONS OF JAVA</h2>
       <p>Web Development: Java is widely used for developing web applications, including dynamic websites, web-based software, and e-commerce applications. Java's ability to provide platform independence and built-in security features make it a popular choice for developing secure and scalable web applications.
       <br>
           Mobile Development: Java is also widely used for developing mobile applications for Android devices. The Android operating system is based on Java, and developers can use Java to write applications that run on Android devices.
           <br>
           Enterprise Software Development: Java is a popular choice for developing enterprise software, including customer relationship management (CRM) systems, supply chain management systems, and financial software. Java's platform independence and robustness make it well-suited for building large-scale enterprise applications.
           <br>
           Scientific Computing: Java is used in scientific computing applications, including data analysis, machine learning, and simulation. Java's object-oriented programming features and large standard library make it a popular choice for developing complex scientific applications.
           <br>
           Internet of Things (IoT): Java is increasingly being used for developing applications for the Internet of Things, which involves connecting a wide range of devices to the internet. Java's ability to provide platform independence and security features make it well-suited for developing IoT applications

<h1>[2] C++</h1>
<p>C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language in the early 1980s by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. It was designed with the aim of providing object-oriented programming features while maintaining compatibility with C.
C++ is a high-level language that supports both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. It is a compiled language, which means that the code must be translated into machine-readable instructions before it can be executed.  
C++ is widely used for developing applications in a variety of domains, including finance, gaming, and scientific computing. Some of the key features of C++ include its support for encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, which make it a popular choice for building complex software systems.   
C++ also provides efficient memory management, a rich library of built-in functions, and the ability to operate at a low-level, making it ideal for systems programming. It has influenced many other programming languages, such as Java, C#, and Python.
<br> 
    Overall, C++ is a versatile and powerful language that continues to be widely used for a range of programming applications, from embedded systems to large-scale software development projects.</p>
<h2>CHARACTERISTICS OF C++</h2>
<P>C++ is a programming language that combines features of both procedural and object-oriented programming paradigms. Some of the key characteristics of C++ are:
<br>
    Object-Oriented Programming: C++ is an object-oriented language, which means that it supports the creation of classes and objects. This allows developers to write code that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.
<br> 
    Efficient Memory Management: C++ provides low-level access to system resources, which makes it an efficient language for managing memory. This allows developers to write code that is fast and responsive, even in memory-constrained environments.
<br>   
    Rich Library of Built-in Functions: C++ provides a large library of built-in functions, including algorithms, data structures, and file I/O. This makes it easier for developers to write code that is both efficient and expressive.
<br>   
    Platform Independence: C++ code can be compiled and executed on a wide range of platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS. This makes it a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of applications.
<br>   
    Compatibility with C: C++ is a direct extension of the C programming language, which means that C++ code can be easily integrated with existing C code. This makes it a popular choice for developers who want to build on top of existing C codebases.
<br>   
    Overall, C++ is a powerful and flexible language that offers a wide range of features and benefits for developers.

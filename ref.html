<h2> Programming Language</h2>
<h3> Introduction of Programming Language</h3>
<p>A programming language is a set of symbols grammars and rules with the help of which one is able to translate
algorithms to programs that will be executed by the computer. The programmer communicates with a machine using programming languages. Most of the programs have a highly structured set of rules.<br>
<h3> Characteristics of Programming Language</h3>
 1. Usability  Easy to learn, ease of use for an experienced programmer.<br>
 2. Performance Speed of program execution, speed of compiler execution (a program which translates the program into machine code), stability (lack of defects).
 <br>3. Portability A portable language is one which is implemented in variety of computers (design relatively machine dependent). Well defined language are more portable than others e.g. C, C++.
<br> 4. Extendibility Possibility of developing the language and its implementation, existence function libraries, class libraries, etc.<br> 5. Continuity Continuity of the manufacturer, language continuity, implementation continuity, existence of international standards for defining the language, comformity of implementation by following standards, existence of other manufacturers for that language.<br><h3> Application of Programming Language </h3>Programming languages are used to build games, embedded software, medical technologies and automation in automobiles. With the changing nature of looking at data, programming languages like R and Python are being heavily used for driving advanced analytics and data science.
